Based on a digital product passport, RepairGPT allows users to virtually interact with their furniture, empowering them to manage repairs and refurbishments themselves. An integrated AI technology enables users to select their product from a comprehensive library through the click of a button, upload photos or videos of damages, and receive tailored guidance and help, including home remedies and step-by-step tutorials, expert assistance, or connections to the manufacturer’s repair program. Moreover, RepairGPT facilitates refurbishments as it lets users virtually visualize changes to their furniture, thus facilitating the decision-making process. In addition to that, it provides easier access to refurbishment options provided by the manufacturer as well as to resell possibilities. RepairGPT doesn’t only contribute to extending the lifetime of furniture, but also enhances the customer-manufacturer relationship.
