GreenGuide benefits from a robust database that incorporates reliable resources focusing on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and sustainability. Startups have the opportunity to contribute to this database by uploading their data. LlamaIndex comes into play by generating context from these inputs, allowing the Large Language Model (LLM) to better understand and interpret them. The integration of reputable sources fortifies GreenGuide's capability to deliver personalized recommendations, precisely aligned with at least one of the 17 SDGs. This strategic fusion of contextual information and reliable data empowers GreenGuide to provide targeted sustainability guidance for startups, fostering impactful and informed decision-making.
