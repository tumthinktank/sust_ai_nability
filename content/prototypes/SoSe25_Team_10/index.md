The developed prototype is a web-based application designed to calculate the true cost of private car ownership in Munich and recommend personalised, sustainable mobility alternatives. Using local datasets, it estimates expenses such as fuel, insurance, maintenance, parking, and emissions-based taxes. The tool collects key user inputs, like car type, usage habits, and parking situation, through an intuitive, interactive interface built in Figma. Based on this input, a GPT-powered engine generates tailored mobility scenarios that combine public transport, cycling, car-sharing, or micro-mobility services. Designed for integration with the existing MucGPT system, the application goes beyond static comparisons to function as an intelligent mobility advisor. By reflecting user preferences and real-life context, it helps citizens visualise how they could live without owning a car. While the broader environmental and system-level
implications will be addressed in the conclusion, this prototype demonstrates how digital, data-driven consultation can support Munich’s shift toward more sustainable mobility.
