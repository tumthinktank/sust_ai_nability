After going through different types of customer reviews, we came to identify 4 main categories of feedback: fatal defects, normal wear and tear, loved features, and improvement suggestions. Review timing, content, focus are all important elements that need to be analyzer at deeper levels. On the short-term, we came up with first a review analyzer that is made to learn and categorize these 4 types and classify reviews accordingly. Then, a chatbot that provides product improvement suggestion for product developers is built on top of that. The next step of our prototype is a plan to develop a visual analyzer that extracts the location of the features. Then a visual analyzer is put into action to associate location and categories. Hence, the product developer has the useful information from reviews at hand.
