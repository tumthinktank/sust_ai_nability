Our Traffic Calming Simulation Portal is an interactive web application that enables users to analyze and predict the impact of traffic-calming interventions in urban environments. Using real-time and historical data on traffic volumes, noise levels, emissions, and user feedback, the portal simulates various scenarios such as modal shifts, improved air quality, or pedestrian safety enhancements. The tool provides intuitive visualizations including interactive maps, timeline sliders, and performance dashboards to support evidence-based decision-making for city planners, researchers, and citizens. Additionally, the platform includes a public feedback module to capture perceptions of change and gauge acceptance. By combining environmental analytics, mobility data, and user experience, PEEMO aims to support sustainable and citizen-friendly city transformation.
