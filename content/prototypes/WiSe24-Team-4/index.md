The Earthlytics team proposes a redesign of the Destination Earth (DestinE) platform to improve usability, accessibility, and engagement. The current platform, while offering powerful digital twins and climate data, suffers from a complex interface and low user adoption, particularly among students, scientists, and professionals. To address this, Earthlytics introduces a personalized onboarding process, which tailors the user experience based on individual needs and expertise. Additionally, an AI assistant helps users navigate the platform, generate summaries, and provide real-time explanations. Gamified tutorials enhance learning by guiding users through simulations, while a community tab fosters collaboration, enabling users to share projects, insights, and best practices. By streamlining access and interaction, the solution aims to increase engagement, expand the user base, and maximize the impact of DestinE for climate research and decision-making.
