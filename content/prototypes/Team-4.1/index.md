The outcome of this challenge was a policy memo with more than ten amendments that 
have the goal of improving and ensuring the use of social sustainable AI system in the 
EU. The policy recommendations cover different areas of the EU Regulation such as the 
extension of prohibited AI systems to facial and emotion recognition systems used in
border control management (Article 5); the obligation for sandbox environments to 
minimize the risks to discriminatory outcomes related to potential unconscious biases, 
health and safety (Articles 53&54), the inclusion of well known social, environmental, and 
economic organizations as authorities within the AI Office: for example the European 
Environment Agency – EEA (Article 57) and the introduction of a shutdown mechanism 
in case the high-risk AI systems exhibit erroneous behavior or produce incorrect answers 
with significant implications
