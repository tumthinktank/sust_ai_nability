The outcome of this challenge was a policy memo with more than ten amendments that 
have the goal of improving and ensuring the use of social sustainable AI system in the 
EU. The policy recommendations cover different areas of the EU Regulation such as the 
extension of prohibited AI systems to facial and emotion recognition systems used in
border control management (Article 5); the obligation for sandbox environments to 
minimize the risks to discriminatory outcomes related to potential unconscious biases, 
health and safety (Articles 53&54), the inclusion of well known social, environmental, and 
economic organizations as authorities within the AI Office: for example the European 
Environment Agency – EEA (Article 57) and the introduction of a shutdown mechanism 
in case the high-risk AI systems exhibit erroneous behavior or produce incorrect answers 
with significant implications

The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad
Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text
didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and
made herself on the way.

But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a
few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with
[Longe and Parole](http://google.com) and dragged her into their agency, where
they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been
rewritten, then they are still using her.

It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your
mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is
an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the
name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.

#### Silent delightfully including because before one up barring chameleon

Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a
large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and
supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in

would be the word "and" and the Little Blind Text should turn around and return
to its own, safe country. But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it
