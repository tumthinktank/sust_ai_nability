A design thinking methodology was applied to address supply chain inefficiencies. The solution involves two main parts: predictive analysis using machine learning to ensure a reliable supply of recycled materials and process optimization for transparency and reliability. A machine learning model, trained on ERP data from waste collection centers, predicts material availability accurately.
Additionally, a decision-making model using AHP and TOPSIS methods rates suppliers, and bundling small quantities of materials increases economic viability.
The innovative business model leverages a modern, integrated platform serving recyclers and manufacturers, developed using the business model canvas. This platform increases recyclers' revenue by enabling the recycling of previously non-profitable waste through efficient bundling. For manufacturers, it guarantees a steady supply of certified recycled materials, aiding in meeting sustainability goals and securing raw materials at competitive prices. The combined software solutions ensure a smooth, transparent process of supplying and procuring recycled materials, benefiting all stakeholders.
