The prototype is a mock AI model that is capable of verifying the validity of an assumption. The AI model does this by analyzing the various aspects of the assumption like the source of the assumption, content, justification, and the person, or organization that made the statement. The final outcome of the prototype is how the system can be experienced in the future to improve the transparency and increase the credibility of assumptions to make decision-making easier. These outcomes will ensure that we can provide information that is at most reliable and without any bias.
