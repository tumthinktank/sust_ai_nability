As part of the challenge, we developed a prototype map illustrating the transport chain between Abfallwirtschaftsbetrieb München (AWM) and BMW. This map provides a detailed visualization of the logistics and flow of materials, highlighting key transit points and connections. By mapping the transport chain, we aim to enhance transparency, optimize routes, and improve the efficiency of material movement within the supply chain. It encompasses all collection points from AWM, disassemblers, black mass producers, and BMW's production site, detailing each step from waste collection to material processing and eventual use in BMW's manufacturing. The map can be extended to not only include stakeholders in Battery recycling but also other
materials, Germany-wide expansion etc.
