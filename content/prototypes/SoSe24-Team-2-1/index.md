The interactive waste heat map consists of different layers, each providing different information necessary for an efficient reuse of waste heat from data centers. The first layer displays the available waste heat from data centers, marked by pins across the region and with red circles representing the amount of waste heat produced. By clicking on the pins relevant data to each data center is provided. This layer can be used for the consideration of new heat sources. The second layer illustrates the heat demand by each area, including industrial and demographic data, highlighting areas with potentially high demand for heating. The third layer combines the first two layers and demonstrates areas with high potential for new data centers, as there is a high heat demand and no already existing data centers nearby.
