The GAID-Platform is designed to empower decision-makers by providing detailed, realtime data on data centers’ energy consumption and waste heat generation. This platform facilitates strategic planning for urban development projects, enabling cities to repurpose waste heat for residential heating and other applications. By integrating interactive maps and predictive analytics, the GAID-Platform ensures transparency and fosters collaboration between data center operators, municipalities, and policymakers. This innovative approach helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and supports the transition to renewable energy. Our goal is to create a sustainable and energy-efficient urban ecosystem, leveraging data center waste heat as a valuable resource.
