SAP Recommerce aims to enhance circularity by reusing items, but there is untapped potential for true circularity. The integration of Digital Twin, Blockchain, and AI technologies is proposed to achieve this. This solution enables the entire fashion supply chain, providing information to customers about product origins and environmental impact and offering incentives for sustainable choices. Additionally, AI systems assist retailers in decision-making and sorting returned items, promoting reusing, remaking, or recycling options. This business model creates a circular fashion economy by delaying disposal and maximizing sustainability. The integrated software as a service and business model involves all value chain actors, offering traceability, and transparency. Digital Twin facilitates simulations, environmental impact calculations, and authentication, while Blockchain ensures trustful traceability and information unity. Artificial Intelligence supports garment screening, optimizing circular processes, and Large Language Models engage customers through nudging and gamification activities. The Digital Twin is created and updated throughout the value chain. Its information and processes are added to the Blockchain, customers can return garments and receive incentives while providing updates, and the AI tool suggests reuse, resale, rent, remake, or recycle options based on the information available, all recorded in the Digital Product Passport (DPP) and Blockchain.
