The EcoOracle enables companies to check the CO2 footprint of their purchases for trustworthiness in order to combat greenwashing. A scoring system is used for this purpose. It calculates the sustainability score of a product taking all the steps of its production chain into account that have an influence on the carbon footprint of a product, for example the used materials and transportation routes. The prototype we developed uses a very simple calculation model that calculates the sum of the weighted production steps. However, the idea is to later replace this primitive calculation method with a neural network that will be able to calculate a more meaningful score based on real validated training data.
Our concept is based on the production of a cotton T-shirt, but can be transferred to any other product. It starts with the cotton harvest and pre-processing and ends with the delivery to a store or the end user.
