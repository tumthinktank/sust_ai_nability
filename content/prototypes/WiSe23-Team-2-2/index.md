The solution leverages AI-driven Comparative Analysis Algorithms for the verification of Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) calculations. Faced with the challenge of diverse and proprietary data models used by companies, our solution benchmarks data against industry standards and similar products. A ranking algorithm assigns weighted scores based on factors such as raw material sourcing, manufacturing processes transportation, and end-of-life considerations Integrated with various certifications, the system ensures a comprehensive evaluation enhancing the accuracy of sustainability assessments. A user-friendly interface enables product and manufacturer searches, providing detailed reports on potential inconsistencies or data
manipulations. This solution empowers stakeholders, including regulatory bodies and sustainability analysts, with actionable insights, promoting transparency, higher data quality, and environmentally responsible business practices for the promise of a decarbonized economy.
