Hope Harbor is an inclusive digital platform designed to support children aged 8–18 affected by domestic violence. It offers interactive visual novels to teach coping strategies and resilience through age-appropriate, engaging storytelling. The platform features an AI chat buddy for anonymous, empathetic support and a resource hub providing child-friendly information and access to local resources via postal codes. Collaborating with schools, teachers, and social workers, Hope Harbor ensures accessibility for all children, regardless of their background or abilities. Features like multilingual support, text-to-speech, and web-based availability enhance inclusivity. By fostering awareness, resilience, and education, Hope Harbor aims to break the intergenerational cycle of abuse and provide lasting, positive impacts on children’s lives.
