Our project addresses Germany's data center e-waste challenge with an innovative approach. It introduces a novel calculation method to quantify data center e-waste (in tonnes), based on equipment put on the market (in megawatts). This approach extends existing e-waste measurement frameworks, enabling yearly estimates of data center e-waste generation based on equipment lifetimes. We integrate this quantification method with an analysis of current German regulations and industry practices. Our gap analysis yields actionable recommendations for policymakers, data center operators, and recycling companies to improve datacenter e-waste management practices. Our solution emphasizes stakeholder collaboration, proposing strategies to enhance data transparency, engage industry leaders, and promote innovative recycling technologies. By offering clear insights and actionable steps, we aim to drive industry-wide sustainable practices, accelerating the transition to a circular economy in the digital sector.
