Our mission is to make family cycling in Munich more accessible and practical by integrating a dedicated rental section for family-friendly bicycles directly within the MVGo app. This initiative helps families discover, select, and rent the ideal bicycle setup according to their destination and travel needs, quickly and easily.
By aligning with the City of Munich’s sustainable mobility goals and supporting the objectives of the Go!Family[1] initiative, EasyRide champions a more inclusive and eco-friendly transport system for local families and visitors alike. We aim to remove logistical barriers, reduce planning stress, and empower parents to explore the city confidently with their children. Through this, we encourage healthier habits, stronger community connections, and an enhanced family experience tailored to real-life needs.
