EcoVision is an interactive web platform that allows citizens to actively shape the future of their neighbourhoods. Through a question-based interface, users can co-create sustainable street designs that reflect local needs and values. Artificial intelligence is integrated into the platform, which generates streets based on the responses received from users. A ranking is then generated and it is possible to vote for the most interesting options. EcoVision bridges the gap between the municipality, professional planning and public engagement, turning community ideas into real urban redevelopment.
