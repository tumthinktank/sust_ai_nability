Our findings, while researching the current situation of AI model cards, showed a lack of sustainability indicators concerning environmental factors used by companies. The theoretical framework around environmental indicators exists though and allows to find around 60 indicators in a short timeframe. We developed two life cycle models to display the levels of environmental impact: The AI hardware life cycle focuses on the areas of production, transport, operation, further development and beyond-life/end-of-life, while the AI software life cycle displays data acquisition, model training, model deployment and beyond-life/end-of-life. The list of indicators along these life cycles can be used for creating AI model cards for which we created a design which allows simple comparability between different AI models. As a result our Green AI Model Cards are enabling citizens as well as companies and states to make informed decisions when it comes to the environmentally sustainable use of AI.
