We have implemented an interactive traffic simulation with a generic aspect, which is currently focused on the city of Kempten. It shows how traffic flows over a specific time period and how this changes when a particular road is blocked, as well as the effect this has on traffic delays, CO􀎍 emissions and noise pollution. It has been developed not only for citizens, who can engage with it by testing it interactively in Kempten's Future Lab, but also to convince political opinion leaders and showcase the positive impact on quality of life and a greener city centre. Our cost-effective simulation can be easily used by end consumers, not only tech-affines, once set up.
