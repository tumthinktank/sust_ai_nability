In response to the challenge "Does the EU AI Act promote social sustainable AI?" we developed
the following key amendments:

- Team diversity: Setting incentives for diverse AI development teams to reduce biases in AI models
- Assessments of high-risk AI systems: Independent assessments by third parties to avoid biases in judgment about discriminatory effects
- Potential for biased input in machine learning models: Avoiding the effects biased inputs due to user group characteristics
  Our aim was to ensure that the AI Act promotes the principles of social sustainability in the
  design, development and deployment of AI technology. We believe that these amendments, if
  adopted, would significantly enhance the Act's effectiveness in fostering a socially sustainable
  AI ecosystem within the European Union.
