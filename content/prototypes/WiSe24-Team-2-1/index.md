When was the last time a driving instructor sat next to you in the car and analyzed or improved your driving style? We are consistently observed and assessed at school, at work and in sport, so why not driving, which has a very high environmental impact and claims thousands of lives every year? JohnnysAI is a recommendation-based artificial intelligence that evaluates user behavior while driving and compares it with other drivers. Anyone who implements these improvements not only helps to protect the climate, but also saves money.
