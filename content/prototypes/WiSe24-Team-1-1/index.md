VanGuard integrates transport and crime data from institutions into its mobile app and in-vehicle kiosk system. The app, integrated with BVG Muva, uses an AI model for predictive analytics and image-based monitoring. This AI-driven approach enables route planning focused on safety by identifying potential risks through AV sensors and feeding optimized routes into the autonomous vehicle's (AV) navigation system. The system synthesizes commuter feedback and area-based insights gathered through an in-app community, enhancing safety and user experience. Emergency services can also tap into this ecosystem for timely interventions. By collecting and harmonizing diverse data inputs, VanGuard prioritizes safety parameters in route planning, fostering a secure commuting environment. The loop of continuous data gathering, analysis, and feedback creates a robust framework for safer urban mobility.
