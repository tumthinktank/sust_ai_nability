Are you looking to minimize the environmental impact of your data center? Our cutting-edge tool is here to assist. This tool not only calculates e-waste estimates based on a sophisticated probability function—which predicts how long hardware remains on the market and considers the weight of hardware sold per year—but also offers invaluable guidance on sustainable hardware disposal.
For data center managers planning to discard or replace hardware, our tool features a quick and easy questionnaire. Based on your responses, it provides tailored recommendations for recycling, refurbishing, or reselling your equipment. These suggestions help ensure that you’re making environmentally responsible decisions, reducing e-waste, and promoting sustainability.
Our user-friendly interface makes it accessible for anyone to generate detailed e-waste forecasts and obtain actionable disposal advice. Embrace a greener future and enhance your data center’s sustainability practices with our innovative e-waste estimation and management tool today.
The output of our work is the probability function estimating the e-waste produced by the data centers and the website which forecasts the amount of waste produced. This coupled with the recycling recommendations can lead to an improved data availability aiding all stakeholders in ensuring that data centers are as environmentally friendly as possible.
