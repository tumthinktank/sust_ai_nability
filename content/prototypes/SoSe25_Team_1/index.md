Zammly is a community-driven mobile app designed to turn everyday citizens into active contributors to urban life. Built in response to concerns about lost parking and neglected public spaces, Zammly empowers users to volunteer for small tasks, like cleaning parklets or watering flowers and earn credits, called “Leaves.” These can be exchanged for local rewards such as parking time, coffee, or cinema discounts. At the same time, the app addresses mobility concerns by offering a simple Park & Pay function and redirecting drivers to nearby underused parking spots. With added features for feedback, issue reporting, and local surveys, Zammly becomes a digital bridge between citizens and city services. The goal is not just to solve problems, but to encourage shared responsibility, strengthen community connection, and make urban space more responsive, accessible, and livable for everyone.
