CARMA is an universal and cohesive data platform for vehicle data. Our solution strives to be as open and fair as possible, with the goal of unifying all vehicle data in one single place. Data will be collected via the existing OBD interface, which every modern car has. We will collect vehicle data, like acceleration and fuel consumption via the OBD interface, consolidate it with the on board gps module, then encrypt and anonymise it and send it to CARMA. To ensure that other manufacturers are willing to share their data, we have created an attractive incentive system. This system is based on rewarding contributions, meaning the more data a manufacturer shares, the more it can receive. CARMA will not directly improve the sustainability or experience of driving, however it is crucial for developing tools that will achieve this, for example Intelligent Urban Infrastructure or Emission Optimisation.
