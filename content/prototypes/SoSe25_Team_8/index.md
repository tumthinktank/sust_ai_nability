StreetAIability is a gamified web app that empowers users to redesign their streets based on personal preferences. Using an interactive Google Maps interface, users can choose any street and redesign it by placing elements focused on greenery, mobility, and communal spaces directly onto the map. As changes are made, the app calculates real-time scores related to air pollution and estimated costs. Once finished, an AI-generated image, created through Google Street View and OpenAI’s DALL·E, visualizes the transformed street. Users can title their design and publish it to a community space, where others can like, share, and compare scores. To encourage real-world impact, users are linked to petition platforms supporting specific designs. Planned features include automatic score integration into petitions, the ability to sign existing petitions, and detailed information screens explaining each element’s impact. StreetAIability blends creativity, data, and civic engagement to inspire sustainable urban transformation.
