AllMove is a mobile app that supports the transition to sustainable mobility by making walking and cycling fun, social, and rewarding. It uses gamification to encourage behavior change: users earn points for eco-friendly travel, unlock achievements, and compete in team rankings. The app visualizes personal progress, shows CO₂ and cost savings, and offers tangible rewards from local sponsors such as cafés, shops, or cultural institutions. A smart AI-based tracking system automatically detects the mode of transport, prevents cheating, and ensures fair rewards.
Designed specifically for the city of Kempten, the app reflects local identity and includes a rollout strategy involving schools, companies, clubs, and the public administration. Through targeted challenges and events, it promotes awareness and engagement across generations. AllMove supports the goals of the “Mobilitätskonzept Kempten 2030” by motivating citizens to adopt more sustainable habits and reducing inner-city car traffic.
The app can serve as a digital tool for dialogue, participation, and real behavioral change.
