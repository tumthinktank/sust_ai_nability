Our prototype enhances both comfort and security in autonomous buses through two interconnected features. First, an infotainment system—accessible via a tablet in front of each passenger—allows users to preview their destination in daylight, find the safest routes, and share their journey with friends and family. To further improve the travel experience, free Wi-Fi and charging ports are provided. Second, integrated sensors inside the bus assess situations in real-time using infrared
technology. If a potentially critical situation arises, the system alerts passengers by displaying relevant information on their tablets. In such cases, each passenger has the option to connect directly with the BVG Control Room, where a human operator can assess the situation and take appropriate action. By combining these technologies, our solution enhances both the actual and perceived safety of autonomous buses, ensuring that all passengers feel secure and empowered to use this innovative form of transportation.
