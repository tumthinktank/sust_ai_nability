Our prototype is a hybrid public participation model that combines a digital AI chatbot with an inperson design thinking workshop to co-create solutions with citizens. The chatbot serves as the starting point, lowering access barriers and enabling broad participation by collecting, analyzing, and clustering input from diverse social groups. It identifies key concerns, needs, and ideas, which are then used to build a structured workshop. This data-driven foundation informs and prepares the subsequent analog workshop, where citizens and stakeholders engage in targeted co-creation and prototyping. The prototype was developed around the real-world use case of
redesigning the Luisentunnel in Fürth but is fully scalable and adaptable to other cities and topics. By merging digital accessibility with human-centered methods, the prototype creates an inclusive, efficient, and replicable participation process that empowers communities and supports better urban decision-making.
