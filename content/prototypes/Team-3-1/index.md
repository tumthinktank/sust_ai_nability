The final prototype presents a prompt designed to address the challenge of extracting and
evaluating key arguments from articles objectively. It introduces a persona of a professional
analyst working for a reputable research organization, ensuring an emotionally neutral tone
throughout the analysis. The format follows a structured approach, with each claim and its basis
clearly delineated using bullet points. The prompt emphasizes concision and encourages the use
of brief bullet points to present the supporting evidence, while also providing citations where
relevant.The prompt establishes a consistent structure for multiple claims, facilitating the analysis
of various articles. By implementing these features, the prototype enables analysts to extract and
evaluate arguments in an unbiased manner, fostering a deeper understanding of the main claims
and the supporting evidence within the given text.
