## About sustAInability

Sustainability and digitalization are at the centre of scientific and political debates as the two significant social transformations of our time. Artificial intelligence (AI) in particular is increasingly coming into focus, permeating more and more areas of public and private life and slowly becoming part of sustainability debates. On the one hand, AI-supported technologies are creating a wide range of opportunities for sustainability, for example in the field of energy transition or agriculture. On the other hand, AI also poses many risks and challenges for the environment and society: Examples range from the high energy consumption and carbon footprint of machine learning systems up to automated discrimination. It is becoming more clear that technology development that follows the Silicon Valley-derived motto of "move fast and break things" is out of step with the current time and is increasingly being critically scrutinised. Sustainability as a central, political and societal goal, can instead serve as an orientation framework for the responsible development of AI (technologies) as well as a compass for their use. For this to succeed, both societal and technical perspectives on the intersection of AI and sustainability are necessary. 



## Partner

sustAInability is a joint project between Hochschule München University of Applied Sciences of Munich and Technical University of Munich, and researches the opportunities and interdependencies, and, together with an interdisciplinary group of students, developes technical and non-technical solution approaches at the intersection of AI and sustainability. It is a so-called digitalization lab and funded by the Bavarian State Ministry of Science and the Arts and coordinated by the Bavarian Research Institute for Digital Transformation (bidt).

The following partners are involved in the digitalization lab: Hochschule für Politik (TUM), School of Management (TUM), TUM Think Tank, Munich Center for Digital Sciences and AI (MUC.DAI, HM).


## Call to Action

Both topics - sustainability and artificial intelligence - are permantely in change and new aspects, tools and techniques arise. Therefore we are constantly looking for new experts and challenges to integrate into our network and master course! 

If you are working on the intersection of AI and sustainability and would like to contribute an input or challenge, feel free to reach out!
