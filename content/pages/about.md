## About sustAInability

Sustainability and artificial intelligence are the two significant social transformations of our time and thus at the centre of scientific and political debates. On the one hand, AI-supported technologies are creating a wide range of opportunities for sustainability, for example in the field of energy transition or agriculture. On the other hand, AI also poses many risks and challenges for the environment and society: Examples range from the high energy consumption and carbon footprint of machine learning systems to automated discrimination. 

In this four-year teaching and research project, we are addressing this area of tension and working together with experts and students on technical and non-technical solutions at the interface of AI & sustainability.

## Partner

sustAInability is a joint project by Technical University of Munich and University of Applied Sciences of Munich. As one out of ten so-called digitalization labs it is funded by the Bavarian State Ministry of Science and the Arts and coordinated by the Bavarian Research Institute for Digital Transformation (bidt).

The following partners are involved in the digitalization lab: School of Social Sciences and Technology (TUM), School of Management (TUM), TUM Think Tank, Munich Center for Digital Sciences and AI (MUC.DAI, HM).

## Call to Action

Both topics - sustainability and artificial intelligence - are permanently in change and new aspects, tools and techniques arise. Therefore we are constantly looking for new experts and organisations who would like to contribute a real world challenge from their practice to the course.

If you would like to contribute an input or challenge, feel free to reach out!

If you are a TUM or HM student and would like to take part in the seminar: Look for SOT86750 in TUMOnline or send an email.
