### About the Department for Mobility - City of Munich
Under the leadership of Georg Dunkel, the Department of Mobility brings together all responsibilities related to transport in Munich, with the aim of making mobility fit for the future.

With the establishment of the Department of Mobility on January 1, 2021, the responsibilities for planning and managing mobility in Munich were consolidated within a single unit. The Department of Mobility serves as the central point of contact for all strategic matters relating to mobility and transport in Munich, as well as the municipal road traffic authority of the state capital.

One of the main tasks of the Department of Mobility is the implementation of the mobility transition in Munich. The Mobility Strategy 2035, adopted by the City Council in summer 2021, provides the roadmap for this process of mobility transformation. The main objectives are as follows: ensuring access to destinations within the city, promoting space-efficient and environmentally friendly modes of transport, and improving quality of life in public spaces.
