### About MCube

MCube - the "Munich Cluster for the Future of Mobility in Metropolitan Regions"- is a flagship initiative with a budget exceeding 50 million euros, dedicated to researching and implementing sustainable mobility innovations and scalable model solutions for Europe and beyond. MCube is funded by the BMFTR (Federal Ministry of Research, Technology and Space) and has been in its second funding phase since November 2024. Under the leadership of the Technical University of Munich and together with over 80 partners from science, business, society and administration, we are shaping the mobility of tomorrow - innovative, sustainable and transferable to other regions.

Our goal is to bring mobility innovations into practice more quickly. To this end, we develop new ideas, business models, administrative principles, co-determination formats, patents and practical prototypes. The focus is on central mobility topics such as autonomous driving, electromobility, smart infrastructures, legal framework conditions and the livable redesign of public spaces.
