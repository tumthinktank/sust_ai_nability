Oliver Alexy is Professor of Innovation and Organization Design, having joined the TUM School of Management in 2012. Previously, he held several roles in the Innovation & Entrepreneurship Group at Imperial College Business School in London, England. He teaches on topics such as organizational design, open innovation, entrepreneurial strategy & growth, and social entrepreneurship in the undergraduate, graduate, and executive programs at TUM School of Management and other schools of TUM, such as Informatics.

### Research

In his research, Oliver studies how to design organizations that effectively deal with extreme uncertainty, such as high-tech start-ups, R&D units, or online communities. His recent interests mainly revolve around questions of how collaboration, knowledge disclosure, or framing strategies may help uncertainty-facing organizations become more legitimate or more innovative, grow or reestablish themselves, or build or commandeer innovation ecosystems.
