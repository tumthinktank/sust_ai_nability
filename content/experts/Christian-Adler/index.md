### About LoopID

LoopID develops digital solutions for the emerging circular economy that enable brands to develop profitable circular business models (e.g. recommerce), improve costs and customer loyalty throughout the product lifecycle (e.g. through take-back) and comply with new regulations (e.g. Digital Product Passport).
At the heart of LoopID is their AI-powered software-as-a-service infrastructure to create and manage semantic digital twins of physical products which comply with the upcoming EU Digital Product Passport regulation. Their solutions include secure take-back systems, innovative recommerce platforms, and end-to-end traceability tools, among others.
Furthermore, innovative features allow customers, for instance, to chat with products such as their running shoes or washing machine to inquire about product properties, repair, take-back, or resale.
